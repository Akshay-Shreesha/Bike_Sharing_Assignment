# Bike_Sharing_Assignment

A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 

In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:

- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- How well those variables describe the bike demands

Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors.

### Data
The data used in this project includes information on daily bike rentals and various factors affecting the demand such as weather conditions, season, holidays, and others. The dataset has been gathered from meteorological surveys and people's behavior.

### Analysis
The analysis performed in this project includes:

### Data exploration and cleaning
Feature engineering and selection
Model building and evaluation
Different machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, random forest, and gradient boosting will be used to build the predictive models.

### Results
The results of the analysis will provide insights on the significant factors affecting the demand for bike sharing services and the prediction accuracy of the models built.

### Technical Details
The project is implemented in Python and uses the following libraries:

- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (for model building and evaluation)

### Conclusion
The Bike Sharing Demand Prediction project aims to provide an understanding of the factors affecting the demand for bike sharing services and build accurate predictive models to help the bike sharing company make data-driven decisions.

### Usage
To run the code, clone the repository and run the Jupyter Notebook file. Ensure that the required libraries are installed.
